[[bootstrap:cache]]
= Configuring a Cache

To use {data-store-name}, you need to either create a new cache or connect to an existing one. With the current version
of {data-store-name}, you can have only one open cache per VM (more strictly speaking, per `ClassLoader`). In most cases,
the cache should only be created once.

NOTE: This section describes the creation and configuration of a peer `Cache` member, appropriate in peer-to-peer (P2P)
topologies and cache servers. A `Cache` member can also be used in stand-alone applications and integration tests.
However, in typical production systems, most application processes act as cache clients, creating a `ClientCache`
instance instead. This is described in the <<bootstrap:cache:client>> and <<bootstrap:region:client>> sections.

A peer `Cache` with default configuration can be created with the following simple declaration:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:cache/>
----

During Spring container initialization, any `ApplicationContext` containing this cache definition registers a
`CacheFactoryBean` that creates a Spring bean named `gemfireCache`, which references a {data-store-name} `Cache` instance.
This bean refers to either an existing `Cache` or, if one does not already exist, a newly created one.  Since no
additional properties were specified, a newly created `Cache` applies the default cache configuration.

All {sdg-name} components that depend on the `Cache` respect this naming convention, so you need not explicitly declare
the `Cache` dependency. If you prefer, you can make the dependency explicit by using the `cache-ref` attribute provided
by various {sdg-acronym} XML namespace elements.  Also, you can override the cache's bean name using the `id` attribute,
as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:cache id="myCache"/>
----

A {data-store-name} `Cache` can be fully configured using Spring. However, {data-store-name}'s native XML configuration
file, `cache.xml`, is also supported.  For situations where the {data-store-name} cache needs to be configured natively,
you can provide a reference to the {data-store-name} XML configuration file by using the `cache-xml-location` attribute,
as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:cache id="cacheConfiguredWithNativeCacheXml" cache-xml-location="classpath:cache.xml"/>
----

In this example, if a cache needs to be created, it uses a file named `cache.xml` located in the classpath root
to configure it.

NOTE: The configuration makes use of Spring's https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#resources[`Resource`]
abstraction to locate the file. The `Resource` abstraction lets various search patterns be used, depending on the runtime environment
or the prefix specified (if any) in the resource location.

In addition to referencing an external XML configuration file, you can also specify {data-store-name} System
{x-data-store-docs}/reference/topics/gemfire_properties.html[properties] that use any of Spring's `Properties`
support features.

For example, you can use the `properties` element defined in the `util` namespace to define `Properties` directly
or load properties from a properties file, as follows:

[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:gfe="{spring-data-schema-namespace}"
       xmlns:util="http://www.springframework.org/schema/util"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    {spring-data-schema-namespace} {spring-data-schema-location}
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/util https://www.springframework.org/schema/util/spring-util.xsd
">

  <util:properties id="gemfireProperties" location="file:/path/to/gemfire.properties"/>

  <gfe:cache properties-ref="gemfireProperties"/>

</beans>
----

Using a properties file is recommended for externalizing environment-specific settings
outside the application configuration.

NOTE: Cache settings apply only when a new cache needs to be created. If an open cache already exists in the VM,
these settings are ignored.

[[bootstrap:cache:advanced]]
== Advanced Cache Configuration

For advanced cache configuration, the `cache` element provides a number of configuration options exposed as attributes
or child elements, as the following listing shows:

[source,xml]
----
<!--1-->
<gfe:cache
    cache-xml-location=".."
    properties-ref=".."
    close="false"
    copy-on-read="true"
    critical-heap-percentage="90"
    eviction-heap-percentage="70"
    enable-auto-reconnect="false" <!--2-->
    lock-lease="120"
    lock-timeout="60"
    message-sync-interval="1"
    pdx-serializer-ref="myPdxSerializer"
    pdx-persistent="true"
    pdx-disk-store="diskStore"
    pdx-read-serialized="false"
    pdx-ignore-unread-fields="true"
    search-timeout="300"
    use-bean-factory-locator="true" <!--3-->
    use-cluster-configuration="false" <!--4-->
>

  <gfe:transaction-listener ref="myTransactionListener"/> <!--5-->

  <gfe:transaction-writer> <!--6-->
    <bean class="org.example.app.gemfire.transaction.TransactionWriter"/>
  </gfe:transaction-writer>

  <gfe:gateway-conflict-resolver ref="myGatewayConflictResolver"/> <!--7-->

  <gfe:jndi-binding jndi-name="myDataSource" type="ManagedDataSource"/> <!--8-->

</gfe:cache>
----

<1> Attributes support various cache options. For further information regarding anything shown in this example,
see the {data-store-name} https://docs.pivotal.io/gemfire[product documentation].
The `close` attribute determines whether the cache should be closed when the Spring application context is closed.
The default is `true`. However, for use cases in which multiple application contexts use the cache
(common in web applications), set this value to `false`.
<2> Setting the `enable-auto-reconnect` attribute to `true` (the default is `false`) lets a disconnected {data-store-name} member
automatically reconnect and rejoin the {data-store-name} cluster.
See the {data-store-name} {x-data-store-docs}/managing/autoreconnect/member-reconnect.html[product documentation]
for more details.
<3> Setting the `use-bean-factory-locator` attribute to `true` (it defaults to `false`) applies only when both
Spring (XML) configuration metadata and {data-store-name} `cache.xml` is used to configure the {data-store-name} cache node
(whether client or peer). This option lets {data-store-name} components (such as `CacheLoader`) expressed in `cache.xml`
be auto-wired with beans (such as `DataSource`) defined in the Spring application context. This option is typically
used in conjunction with `cache-xml-location`.
<4> Setting the `use-cluster-configuration` attribute to `true` (the default is `false`) enables a {data-store-name} member to
retrieve the common, shared Cluster-based configuration from a Locator.
See the {data-store-name} {x-data-store-docs}/configuring/cluster_config/gfsh_persist.html[product documentation]
for more details.
<5> Example of a `TransactionListener` callback declaration that uses a bean reference. The referenced bean must implement
{x-data-store-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/TransactionListener.html[TransactionListener].
A `TransactionListener` can be implemented to handle transaction related events (such as afterCommit and afterRollback).
<6> Example of a `TransactionWriter` callback declaration using an inner bean declaration. The bean must implement
{x-data-store-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/TransactionWriter.html[TransactionWriter].
The `TransactionWriter` is a callback that can veto a transaction.
<7> Example of a `GatewayConflictResolver` callback declaration using a bean reference. The referenced bean
must implement {x-data-store-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/util/GatewayConflictResolver.html
[GatewayConflictResolver].
A `GatewayConflictResolver` is a `Cache`-level plugin that is called upon to decide what to do with events
that originate in other systems and arrive through the WAN Gateway.
which provides a distributed Region creation service.
<8> Declares a JNDI binding to enlist an external DataSource in a {data-store-name} transaction.

[[bootstrap:cache:pdx-serialization]]
=== Enabling PDX Serialization

The preceding example includes a number of attributes related to {data-store-name}'s enhanced serialization framework, PDX.
While a complete discussion of PDX is beyond the scope of this reference guide, it is important to note that PDX
is enabled by registering a `PdxSerializer`, which is specified by setting the `pdx-serializer` attribute.

{data-store-name} provides an implementing class (`org.apache.geode.pdx.ReflectionBasedAutoSerializer`) that uses
Java Reflection. However, it is common for developers to provide their own implementation. The value of the attribute
is simply a reference to a Spring bean that implements the `PdxSerializer` interface.

More information on serialization support can be found in <<serialization>>.

[[boostrap:cache:auto-reconnect]]
=== Enabling Auto-reconnect

You should be careful when setting the `<gfe:cache enable-auto-reconnect="[true|false*]>` attribute to `true`.

Generally, 'auto-reconnect' should only be enabled in cases where {sdg-name}'s XML namespace is used to configure
and bootstrap a new, non-application {data-store-name} server added to a cluster.  In other words, 'auto-reconnect'
should not be enabled when {sdg-name} is used to develop and build a {data-store-name} application that also happens
to be a peer `Cache` member of the {data-store-name} cluster.

The main reason for this restriction is that most {data-store-name} applications use references to the {data-store-name}
`Cache` or Regions in order to perform data access operations. These references are "`injected`" by the Spring container
into application components (such as Repositories) for use by the application. When a peer member is forcefully
disconnected from the rest of the cluster, presumably because the peer member has become unresponsive or a
network partition separates one or more peer members into a group too small to function as an independent
distributed system, the peer member shuts down and all {data-store-name} component references (caches, Regions,
and others) become invalid.

Essentially, the current forced disconnect processing logic in each peer member dismantles the system from the ground up.
The JGroups stack shuts down, the distributed system is put in a shutdown state and, finally, the cache is closed.
Effectively, all memory references become stale and are lost.

After being disconnected from the distributed system, a peer member enters a "`reconnecting`" state and periodically
attempts to rejoin the distributed system. If the peer member succeeds in reconnecting, the member rebuilds its "`view`"
of the distributed system from existing members and receives a new distributed system ID.  Additionally, all caches,
Regions, and other {data-store-name} components are reconstructed. Therefore, all old references, which may have been
injected into application by the Spring container, are now stale and no longer valid.

{data-store-name} makes no guarantee (even when using the {data-store-name} public Java API) that application cache,
Regions, or other component references are automatically refreshed by the reconnect operation. As such, {data-store-name}
applications must take care to refresh their own references.

Unfortunately, there is no way to be notified of a disconnect event and, subsequently, a reconnect event either.
If that were the case, you would have a clean way to know when to call `ConfigurableApplicationContext.refresh()`,
if it were even applicable for an application to do so, which is why this "`feature`" of {data-store-name} is not
recommended for peer `Cache` applications.

For more information about 'auto-reconnect', see {data-store-name}'s
{x-data-store-docs}/managing/autoreconnect/member-reconnect.html[product documentation].

[[bootstrap:cache:cluster-configuration]]
=== Using Cluster-based Configuration

{data-store-name}'s Cluster Configuration Service is a convenient way for any peer member joining the cluster to get
a "`consistent view`" of the cluster by using the shared, persistent configuration maintained by a Locator.
Using the cluster-based configuration ensures the peer member's configuration is compatible with the {data-store-name}
Distributed System when the member joins.

This feature of {sdg-name} (setting the `use-cluster-configuration` attribute to `true`) works in the same way
as the `cache-xml-location` attribute, except the source of the {data-store-name} configuration meta-data comes
from the network through a Locator, as opposed to a native `cache.xml` file residing in the local file system.

All {data-store-name} native configuration metadata, whether from `cache.xml` or from the Cluster Configuration Service,
gets applied before any Spring (XML) configuration metadata.  As a result, Spring's config serves to "`augment`" the
native {data-store-name} configuration metadata and would most likely be specific to the application.

Again, to enable this feature, specify the following in the Spring XML config:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:cache use-cluster-configuration="true"/>
----

NOTE: While certain {data-store-name} tools, such as _Gfsh_, have their actions "`recorded`" when schema-like changes
are made (for example, `gfsh>create region --name=Example --type=PARTITION`), {sdg-name}'s configuration metadata
is not recorded. The same is true when using {data-store-name}'s public Java API directly. It, too, is not recorded.

For more information on {data-store-name}'s Cluster Configuration Service, see the
{x-data-store-docs}/configuring/cluster_config/gfsh_persist.html[product documentation].

[[bootstrap:cache:server]]
== Configuring a {data-store-name} CacheServer

{sdg-name} includes dedicated support for configuring a
{x-data-store-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/server/CacheServer.html[CacheServer],
allowing complete configuration through the Spring container, as the following example shows:

[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
       xmlns:gfe="{spring-data-schema-namespace}"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/context https://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd
    {spring-data-schema-namespace} {spring-data-schema-location}
">

  <gfe:cache/>

  <!-- Example depicting serveral {data-store-name} CacheServer configuration options -->
  <gfe:cache-server id="advanced-config" auto-startup="true"
       bind-address="localhost" host-name-for-clients="localhost" port="${gemfire.cache.server.port}"
       load-poll-interval="2000" max-connections="22" max-message-count="1000" max-threads="16"
       max-time-between-pings="30000" groups="test-server">

    <gfe:subscription-config eviction-type="ENTRY" capacity="1000" disk-store="file://${java.io.tmpdir}"/>

  </gfe:cache-server>

  <context:property-placeholder location="classpath:cache-server.properties"/>

</beans>
----

The preceding configuration shows the `cache-server` element and the many available options.

NOTE: Rather than hard-coding the port, this configuration uses Spring's
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#xsd-config-body-schemas-context[context]
namespace to declare a `property-placeholder`. A
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-placeholderconfigurer[property placeholder]
reads one or more properties files and then replaces property placeholders with values at runtime. Doing so lets administrators
change values without having to touch the main application configuration. Spring also provides
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#expressions[SpEL]
and an https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-environment[environment abstraction]
to support externalization of environment-specific properties from the main codebase, easing deployment across multiple machines.

NOTE: To avoid initialization problems, the `CacheServer` started by {sdg-name} starts *after* the Spring container
has been fully initialized. Doing so lets potential Regions, listeners, writers or instantiators that are defined
declaratively to be fully initialized and registered before the server starts accepting connections. Keep this in mind
when programmatically configuring these elements, as the server might start before your components and thus not be seen
by the clients connecting right away.

[[bootstrap:cache:client]]
== Configuring a {data-store-name} ClientCache

In addition to defining a {data-store-name} peer {x-data-store-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/Cache.html[`Cache`],
{sdg-name} also supports the definition of a {data-store-name} {x-data-store-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/client/ClientCache.html[`ClientCache`]
in a Spring container.  A `ClientCache` definition is similar in configuration and use to the {data-store-name} peer <<bootstrap:cache,Cache>>
and is supported by the `org.springframework.data.gemfire.client.ClientCacheFactoryBean`.

The simplest definition of a {data-store-name} cache client using default configuration follows:

[source,xml]
----
<beans>
  <gfe:client-cache/>
</beans>
----

`client-cache` supports many of the same options as the <<bootstrap:cache:advanced,Cache>> element. However, as opposed
to a full-fledged peer `Cache` member, a cache client connects to a remote cache server through a Pool. By default,
a Pool is created to connect to a server running on `localhost` and listening to port `40404`. The default Pool is used
by all client Regions unless the Region is configured to use a specific Pool.

Pools can be defined with the `pool` element.  This client-side Pool can be used to configure connectivity directly to
a server for individual entities or for the entire cache through one or more Locators.

For example, to customize the default Pool used by the `client-cache`, the developer needs to define a Pool and wire it
to the cache definition, as the following example shows:

[source,xml]
----
<beans>
  <gfe:client-cache id="myCache" pool-name="myPool"/>

  <gfe:pool id="myPool" subscription-enabled="true">
    <gfe:locator host="${gemfire.locator.host}" port="${gemfire.locator.port}"/>
  </gfe:pool>
</beans>
----

The `<client-cache>` element also has a `ready-for-events` attribute. If the attribute is set to `true`, the client cache
initialization includes a call to {x-data-store-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/client/ClientCache.html#readyForEvents[`ClientCache.readyForEvents()`].

<<bootstrap:region:client>> covers client-side configuration in more detail.

[[bootstrap:cache:client:pool]]
=== {data-store-name}'s DEFAULT Pool and {sdg-name} Pool Definitions

If a {data-store-name} `ClientCache` is local-only, then no Pool definition is required. For instance, you can define
the following:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:client-cache/>

<gfe:client-region id="Example" shortcut="LOCAL"/>
----

In this case, the "`Example`" Region is `LOCAL` and no data is distributed between the client and a server. Therefore,
no Pool is necessary. This is true for any client-side, local-only Region, as defined by the {data-store-name}'s
{x-data-store-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/client/ClientRegionShortcut.html[`ClientRegionShortcut`]
(all `LOCAL_*` shortcuts).

However, if a client Region is a (caching) proxy to a server-side Region, a Pool is required. In that case,
there are several ways to define and use a Pool.

When a `ClientCache`, a Pool, and a proxy-based Region are all defined but not explicitly identified, {sdg-name}
resolves the references automatically, as the following example shows:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:client-cache/>

<gfe:pool>
  <gfe:locator host="${geode.locator.host}" port="${geode.locator.port}"/>
</gfe:pool>

<gfe:client-region id="Example" shortcut="PROXY"/>
----

In the preceding example, the `ClientCache` is identified as `gemfireCache`, the Pool as `gemfirePool`,
and the client Region as "`Example`".  However, the `ClientCache` initializes {data-store-name}'s `DEFAULT` Pool
from `gemfirePool`, and the client Region uses the `gemfirePool` when distributing data between the client
and the server.

Basically, {sdg-name} resolves the preceding configuration to the following:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:client-cache id="gemfireCache" pool-name="gemfirePool"/>

<gfe:pool id="gemfirePool">
  <gfe:locator host="${geode.locator.host}" port="${geode.locator.port}"/>
</gfe:pool>

<gfe:client-region id="Example" cache-ref="gemfireCache" pool-name="gemfirePool" shortcut="PROXY"/>
----

{data-store-name} still creates a Pool called `DEFAULT`. {sdg-name} causes the `DEFAULT` Pool to be initialized
from the `gemfirePool`. Doing so is useful in situations where multiple Pools are defined and client Regions
are using separate Pools, or do not declare a Pool at all.

Consider the following:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:client-cache pool-name="locatorPool"/>

<gfe:pool id="locatorPool">
  <gfe:locator host="${geode.locator.host}" port="${geode.locator.port}"/>
</gfe:pool>

<gfe:pool id="serverPool">
  <gfe:server host="${geode.server.host}" port="${geode.server.port}"/>
</gfe:pool>

<gfe:client-region id="Example" pool-name="serverPool" shortcut="PROXY"/>

<gfe:client-region id="AnotherExample" shortcut="CACHING_PROXY"/>

<gfe:client-region id="YetAnotherExample" shortcut="LOCAL"/>
----

In this setup, the {data-store-name} `client-cache` `DEFAULT` pool is initialized from `locatorPool`,
as specified by the `pool-name` attribute. There is no {sdg-name}-defined `gemfirePool`, since both Pools
were explicitly identified (named) -- `locatorPool` and `serverPool`, respectively.

The "`Example`" Region explicitly refers to and exclusively uses the `serverPool`. The `AnotherExample` Region uses
{data-store-name}'s `DEFAULT` Pool, which, again, was configured from the `locatorPool` based on the client cache
bean definition's `pool-name` attribute.

Finally, the `YetAnotherExample` Region does not use a Pool, because it is `LOCAL`.

NOTE: The `AnotherExample` Region would first look for a Pool bean named `gemfirePool`, but that would require
the definition of an anonymous Pool bean (that is, `<gfe:pool/>`) or a Pool bean explicitly named `gemfirePool`
(for example, `<gfe:pool id="gemfirePool"/>`).

NOTE: If we either changed the name of `locatorPool` to `gemfirePool` or made the Pool bean definition be anonymous,
it would have the same effect as the preceding configuration.
